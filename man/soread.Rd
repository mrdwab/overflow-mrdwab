\title{Read in StackOverflow pasted table-formatted data}
\usage{
soread(sep = "", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, out = "mydf")
}
\arguments{
\item{sep}{character. Determines the field separator character passed to \code{read.table}.}

\item{header}{logical. Determines whether the first row consists of names of variables.}

\item{stringsAsFactors}{logical. Whether strings are converted to factors or remain character variables.}

\item{out}{character. Desired output object name. Defaults to \code{"mydf"}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame as \code{read.table} produces.
}
\description{
A wrapper for \link{read.table}. Reads a table from text or from the clipboard and creates a data.frame from it.
}
\details{
For many questions at Stack Overflow, the question asker does not properly
share their question (for example, using \code{\link{dput}} or by sharing
some commands to make up the data). Most of the time, you can just copy and
paste the text into R using \code{read.table(text = "clipboard", header =
TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)}.  This function is basically a convenience
function for the above.

The output of \code{\link{soread}} is automatically assigned to an object in
your workspace called "\code{mydf}" unless specified using the \code{out}
argument.
}
\note{
By default, stringsAsFactors is FALSE which is different to the R default.

\dontrun{
## Copy the following text (select and ctrl-c)

# A B
# 1 2
# 3 4
# 5 6

## Now, just type:

soread()
}
